# [PBI] H003 - Balance Tuning v2 (v0.9.0 Mechanics)

## Description
Balance all Phase H mechanics for fair & fun gameplay:
1. Chain Frost Bolt - tune bounce damage reduction, slow duration, chain count by level
2. Brotherhood Combo - calibrate charge rates (currently 5/8/15/25) and cooldown (15s)
3. Mini-boss generals - balance ability damage, cooldowns, and HP scaling per floor
4. Thrown weapons - ensure shuriken/kunai/crossbow are competitive vs melee/projectile
5. Ranger hero - verify Eagle Eye range bonus + distance scaling feels good
6. Morale → Brotherhood interaction check

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chain Frost bounce damage falls off 70%→50%→30% per bounce
- [ ] Brotherhood gauge fills in ~60-90 seconds of active combat
- [ ] All 12 generals feel distinct but fair (no instant kills below floor 10)
- [ ] Ranger DPS comparable to other heroes when played at max range
- [ ] Thrown weapons competitive in tier list
